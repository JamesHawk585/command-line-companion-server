This method returns a string representing random bytes suitable for cryptographic purposes. The size parameter determines the number of random bytes to generate.\n\n\nEach time you run this code, a different set of random bytes will be output. \n\nWhen working with the output of os.urandom(), it's important to understand that the result is in bytes format.
